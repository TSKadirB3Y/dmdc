Please do not make changes to the .js files at the root directory!  
Only make changes to the change the files inside the `src/` folder, otherwise I can't merge your changes back to the project.

If you're unfamilliar with compiled Javascript:

1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the terminal inside the cloned directory
3. Run `npm i` to download the project dependencies 
4. Run `npm start` it will automatically compile the project, when you make changes
